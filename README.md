# web-terminal

- A simple Node.js application that simulates a shell terminal and allows users to execute basic commands on a web interface, similar to what you would do in a terminal. It's a simple concept but a great exercise.

```sh
npm i
npm start
```

- Finally, visit ```http://localhost:3000/``` in your web browser to access the mini web app. Feel free to enjoy this app and modify it as you like.
